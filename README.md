This is a mutliplayer game. But don't worry, you can play it by yourself. Just open the game four times, click on
'host game' on the main menu for one of them, and click 'join game' on the other three opened games. Click the 'ready' 
button on each game and congratulations, you are now playing with yourself! However, if you have friends, you can play 
with them over a LAN.

Anyway, each player needs to hold space to move the spaceship in a direction. Each player can move the spaceship in one 
direction. So you'll need to cooperate to work out who's moving the ship in what direction and to actually move it.

Dodge the Inconvenient Space Rocks that are in the way. Fly into the Cube That Allows You To Score Points to score 
points and recover hitpoints. And try not to die in a stupid and tragic way.
